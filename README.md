A portfolio app created in React JS with advanced animations.

The app has a sidebar which is also the navbar of the website.

On hovering on the icons in the sidebar name of the pages are displayed (Home, Contact, About)

On each of the pages the title of the pages are animated and have a very nice bouncing animation on hover.

While on the home page on the right hand their is a very cool animation in which an S is drawn and filled when the page loads.

On the About page their is a rotating Cube animation on the right hand which has different techs that i work in (Logos of techs)

While on the contact page their is a map on the right side of the location that shows a pin dropped on the location where i currently reside (kind of).

There is also a pacman loader that is displayed before any content is diplayed on each of the pages.


Packages that i used to complete this project are:

"emailjs" for sending email in the contact page (currently this code is removed as it contained my personal token),
"fortawesome" for the icons used,
"gsap" for the animations,
"react-leaflet" for the maps,
"react-loaders" for the pacman loader,
"react-router" for routing,
"sass" for styling,
